ðŸ”´ Introduction
- Cryptograhpy can provide solutions to the following requirements while communicating :-
  1. **Authentication**: YOu want to be sure you communicate with the right person, not someone else pretending.
  2.** Authenticity**:  You can verify that the information comes from the claimed source.
  3. **Integrity**: You must ensure that no changes the data you exchange.
  4. **Confidentiality**: You want to prevent an unauthorised party from eavesdropping on your conversations.

- Private key cryptography i.e symmetric encryption protects mainly confidentiality.
- Public Key Cryptography i.e., asymmetric crptography fullfil all requirements.

ðŸ”´ Common use of Asymmetric Encryption
- Asymmetric cryptography is used to exchange keys for symmetric encryption.
- Asymmetric cryptography is relatively slower than symmetric encryption.
- Asymmetric cryptography only used once to get the symmetric encryption cipher and key and then one can communicate privately using symmetric encryption.
