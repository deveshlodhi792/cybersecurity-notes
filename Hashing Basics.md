ðŸ”´ Introducation
-  If we want to know that if the file whe have downloaded is identical to the original file, bit for bit, then we have to compare the hash values of both files.
-  If the hash values are equal of both files then with high certainity we can say these both files are identical.
-  Hash value is a fixed-size string or characters that is computed by a hash function.
-  A hash function helps to generate the hash value.
-  Hash function takes an input of any size and returns an output of fixed length,i.e. hash value.

ðŸ”´ Hash Function
-  Hash functions generate hash values and they are different from encryption.
-  It is impossible or computationally impractical to go from the output back to the input, as there is no key included in this process.
-  A hash function takes some input data of any size and creates a summary or digest of that data. The output has a fixed size.
-  One cannot predict the ouput for any input and vice-versa.
-  Good hashing algorithms are those which compute hash values fast and are nearly impossible to reverse, i.e., go from the ouptut and determine the input.
-  Any slight change in the input data, even a single bit, can result in significant change in output.
-  The output of a hash function is in raw bytes and then it encoded into base64 or hexaecimal.
-  md5sum, sha1sum, sha256sum and sha512sum produce their output in hexadecimal format.
-  Each raw byte = two hexadecimal digits.
-  **hexdump -C file1.txt**- to see text file into hexadecimal format.
-  md5sum *.txt - to encode with md5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5)
-  sha1sum *.txt - to encode with sha1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
-  sha256sum *.txt - to encode with sha-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256)

-  **Why is Hashing Important?**
  1.  Hashing helps protect data's integrity and ensure password confientiality.
  2.  When we log into a website, the server uses hashing to verfiy our password.
  3.  Server records the hash value of our passwords only.

-  **What's a Hash Collision?**
  1.  When two different inputs gives the same output (hash value), then it is called a hash collision.
  2.  Hash functions are designed to avoid collisions and prevent an attacker from being able to create a collision intentionally.
The number of inputs is unlimited and the number of possible outputs is limited, this leads to a pigeonhole effect.
If a hash function produces 4-bit hash value then we have 16, i.e 2^4 = 16, different hash values and therefore there is high probability of hash collision.
However, a good hash function ensure that the probability of a collision is neglibile.
MD5 and SHA1 are considered insecure due to the ability to engineer hash collisions.
MD5 and SHA1 are based on two different algorithm so there is no attack has yet given a collision in both algorithms simultaneously.

ðŸ”´ Insecure Password Storage for Authentication
-  Hashing has many uses in Cyber security.
-  Two of them are Password storage and Data integrity.
-  Password storage here mean to store password (usually in hashed form) for authentication purpose.
-  Password managers does not store passwords in hash form, they used encryption to store them as we have to retrieve them in clear text to apply on the website for authentication.
-  Storing passwords in plaintext is a very insecure secruity practice for any web applications or website.
-  These are three insecure practices for security of passwords:-
    1.  Storing passwords in plaintext
    2.  Storing passwords using a deprecated encryption.
    3.  Storing passwords using an insecure hashing algorithm like SHA-1, MD5.
