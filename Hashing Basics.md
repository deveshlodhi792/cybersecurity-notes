ðŸ”´ Introducation
-  If we want to know that if the file whe have downloaded is identical to the original file, bit for bit, then we have to compare the hash values of both files.
-  If the hash values are equal of both files then with high certainity we can say these both files are identical.
-  Hash value is a fixed-size string or characters that is computed by a hash function.
-  A hash function helps to generate the hash value.
-  Hash function takes an input of any size and returns an output of fixed length,i.e. hash value.

ðŸ”´ Hash Function
-  Hash functions generate hash values and they are different from encryption.
-  It is impossible or computationally impractical to go from the output back to the input, as there is no key included in this process.
-  A hash function takes some input data of any size and creates a summary or digest of that data. The output has a fixed size.
-  One cannot predict the ouput for any input and vice-versa.
-  Good hashing algorithms are those which compute hash values fast and are nearly impossible to reverse, i.e., go from the ouptut and determine the input.
-  Any slight change in the input data, even a single bit, can result in significant change in output.
