🔴 Introduction
-  John the Ripper is a well-known, well-loved and versatile hash-cracking tool.
-  It combines a fast cracking speed with an extraordinary range of compatible hash types.

🔴 Basics Terms
-  Hash: Hash (or hash value, digest) is the representation of arbitrary size of data in a fixed-length form. The hash value is obtained by running the original data through a hashing algorithm like MD4, MD5, SHA1 and NTLM.
-  Hash values are nearly irreversible because hashing functions designed as one-way. Thats why It is hard to find the original input if we given the hash value only.
-  John the Ripper (John)
  1.  If we have the hashed verison of password and also know the hashing algorithm it is possible to crack the hash value.
  2.  We can use the hashing algorithm to hash a large number of words, called a dictionary.
  3.  We can compare these hashes to the one we are trying to crack to see if they match.
  4.  If one of the hashes match with the hash value you are trying to crack then you have cracked it.
  5.  This way the John the Ripper or John (shortened) tool conduct fast brute force attacks on various hash types.
  6.  This process is called a dictionary attack.

🔴 Setting Up Your System
-  To crack passwords, we use
  1.  The "Jumbo John" version of John the Ripper
  2.  The RockYou password list
-  Other version of John does not have tools such as zip2john an rar2john.
-  sudo apt install john - for Ubuntu and Kali distribution. You will get "John the Ripper 1.9.0-jumbo-1" on Kali but for Ubuntu you have to build from the source to access all the tools available via Jumbo John.
-  For windows one can download and install zipped binary binary.
