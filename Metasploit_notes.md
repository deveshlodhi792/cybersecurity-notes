🔴 Introduction
- Metasploit Framework is an open-source version of metasploit that works from the command line.
- Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more.
- Primary usage of the Metasploit Framework is penetration testing but it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.
- Main components of the Metasploit Framework
  *  msfconsole : The main command-line interface.
  *  Modules :  Supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
  *  Tools : Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset.

🔴 Main Components of Metasploit
- msfconsole - command to open metasploit and interact with the metasploit console.
- Modules - small components within the Metasploit Framework. Built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.
- Exploit - A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- Vulnerability - a desgin, coding or logic flaw that can affect the target system. vulnerability exploitation can result in disclosing of confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute the code on target system.
- Payload - codes that will run on the target system to acheive the results we want like reading of confidential information on the target system.
- exploits find and use vulnerability to execute payloads on the target system to take the information from the system.
